> _Follow the argument wherever it leads._ — Socrates, in Plato's _Republic_

argue is a structured multi-agent debate engine. Multiple AI agents analyze the same problem independently, challenge each other's claims across rounds, and converge on consensus through voting — producing higher quality results than any single agent alone.

Give it a question. Get back claims that survived cross-examination, votes that quantify agreement, and a representative report backed by peer-reviewed scoring. Less hallucination, more rigor.

## Live Demo

[![A sample argue report rendered in the hosted viewer](docs/assets/argue-report-sample.jpeg)](https://argue.onev.cat/example)

**[https://argue.onev.cat/example](https://argue.onev.cat/example)** — a real argue run rendered in the hosted viewer. Open it to see exactly what argue produces:

- **Agents arguing in the open.** Every claim, peer judgement, merge, and vote, round by round.
- **A polished dossier.** Composed by the highest-scoring agent — ready to read, share, or attach to a PR.
- **Complete raw data on disk.** The same JSON that powers the viewer is saved locally, ready to feed any downstream step (review bot, code generation, audit log, …).

## Install the Argue Skill

Already working with an agentic coding assistant (Claude Code, Codex, etc.)? Hand the setup over. Argue ships as an [agent skill](https://skills.sh/) that teaches your agent when to use argue, how to install and configure the CLI, which defaults to recommend, and how to run debates end-to-end.

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/onevcat/argue --skill argue
```

Once installed, just ask your agent to "argue about X" or "get a second opinion on Y". It will bootstrap the CLI on first run (asking you before any global install) and drive the debate, the report, and any follow-up action for you.

## Quick Start

Prefer driving the CLI yourself like a cave-dweller with a stone axe? Suit yourself — here's the manual route.

### Install

```bash
npm install -g @onevcat/argue-cli
```

### Configure

```bash
# Create config file (~/.config/argue/config.json)
argue config init

# Add providers and agents
argue config add-provider --id claude --type cli --cli-type claude --model-id sonnet --agent claude-agent
argue config add-provider --id codex --type cli --cli-type codex --model-id gpt-5.3-codex --agent codex-agent
```

### Run a Debate

```bash
argue run --task "Should we use a monorepo or polyrepo for our microservices?"
```

Add `--verbose` to see each agent's reasoning, claims, and judgements in real time.

Need an agent to **act** on the result? Add `--action`:

```bash
argue run \
  --task "Review the issue: https://github.com/onevcat/argue/issues/22" \
  --action "Fix the issue based on consensus and open a PR" \
  --verbose
```

### What Happens

```
[argue] run started
  task: 研究这个 issue 的解法：https://github.com/onevcat/argue/issues/22
  agents: claude-agent, codex-agent | rounds: 2..3

[argue] initial#0  codex-agent (claims+6) — ESLint+Prettier setup, CI lint gate
[argue] initial#0  claude-agent (claims+6) — runtime bugs (couldn't access the issue URL)

[argue] debate#1   codex-agent (1✗ 5↻) — claude's claims valid but out-of-scope
[argue] debate#1   claude-agent (5✗ 1↻) — agreed, self-corrected
[argue] debate#1   claim merged c6 -> c2
  ... 2 more rounds, agents refine and converge ...

[argue] final_vote  11/11 claims accepted unanimously
[argue] result: consensus — codex-agent representative (83.70)
[argue] action: codex-agent opened PR #28
```

codex-agent accessed the issue and proposed ESLint/Prettier claims. claude-agent couldn't reach the URL and found runtime bugs instead. Through debate, codex-agent flagged them as out-of-scope, claude-agent self-corrected, and both converged. All 11 claims passed unanimously. The representative turned consensus into [a real PR](https://github.com/onevcat/argue/pull/28).

After each run, argue writes three output files to `~/.argue/output/<requestId>/` (global config) or `./out/<requestId>/` (local config):

| File           | Contents                                                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `events.jsonl` | Streaming event log — every dispatch, response, merge, vote, and score          |
| `result.json`  | Structured result — status, claims, resolutions, scores, representative, action |
| `summary.md`   | Human-readable report from the representative agent                             |

[See the full unabridged output of this run.](https://gist.github.com/onevcat/bbf42778888180c443bea78f395f255b)

### View the Report

After every run, argue prints a hint telling you how to open the report in the hosted viewer:

```
→ View report: argue view argue_1712345678901_a3f9c2
```

You can also open the most recent run directly:

```bash
argue view                  # open the most recent run
argue view <request-id>     # open a specific run
argue run --view            # open automatically after a run completes
```

The report is gzip-compressed and base64url-encoded into the URL fragment, then decoded entirely in the browser — **nothing is uploaded to any server**. The default viewer is hosted at `https://argue.onev.cat/`. To point at a different viewer (for example, during local viewer development), set `viewer.url` in your config or pass `--viewer-url https://your-viewer/`.

### Common Options

For complex or repeated tasks, use an [input JSON file](https://github.com/onevcat/argue/blob/master/packages/argue-cli/examples/task.example.json) instead of inline flags:

```bash
argue run --input task.json
```

Useful flags:

```bash
--agents a1,a2                            # pick specific agents from config
--min-participants 2                      # minimum surviving participants required to continue
--on-insufficient-participants interrupt  # interrupt (default) or fail hard
--min-rounds 2                            # at least 2 debate rounds before early-stop
--max-rounds 5                            # cap total debate rounds
--threshold 0.67                          # consensus threshold (default: 1.0 = unanimous)
--action "Fix it"                         # post-debate action for the representative
--verbose                                 # show each agent's reasoning in real time
```

Run `argue --help` for the full list.

> **Behavior change in 0.5.0:** when surviving participants drop below `minParticipants`, argue now returns a structured `interrupted` result instead of throwing a hard error. Pass `--on-insufficient-participants fail` (or set `defaults.participantsPolicy.onInsufficientParticipants: "fail"` in config) to restore the previous behavior.

## Using as a Library

Behind argue-cli is `@onevcat/argue`, a standalone debate engine you can embed in any system. Implement one interface — `AgentTaskDelegate` — and the engine handles all orchestration.

### Install

```bash
npm install @onevcat/argue
```

### Implement the Delegate

```ts
import type { AgentTaskDelegate } from "@onevcat/argue";

const delegate: AgentTaskDelegate = {
  async dispatch(task) {
    // Fire off the task and return a taskId immediately.
    // The engine dispatches all participants in parallel, then awaits
    // results separately — so this should return quickly without waiting for completion.
    const taskId = await myAgentFramework.submit(task);
    return { taskId, participantId: task.participantId, kind: task.kind };
  },

  async awaitResult(taskId, timeoutMs) {
    // Called per task to collect the result. The engine uses the taskId
    // to track timeouts, eliminations, and progressive settlement.
    const result = await myAgentFramework.waitFor(taskId, timeoutMs);
    return { ok: true, output: result };
  }
};
```

### Run the Engine

```ts
import { ArgueEngine, MemorySessionStore, DefaultWaitCoordinator } from "@onevcat/argue";

const engine = new ArgueEngine({
  taskDelegate: delegate,
  sessionStore: new MemorySessionStore(),
  waitCoordinator: new DefaultWaitCoordinator(delegate)
});

const result = await engine.start({
  requestId: "review-42",
  task: "Review PR #42 for security and correctness issues",
  participants: [
    { id: "security-agent", role: "security-reviewer" },
    { id: "arch-agent", role: "architecture-reviewer" },
    { id: "correctness-agent", role: "correctness-reviewer" }
  ],
  roundPolicy: { minRounds: 2, maxRounds: 4 },
  consensusPolicy: { threshold: 0.67 },
  reportPolicy: { composer: "representative" },
  actionPolicy: {
    prompt: "Fix all identified issues and post a summary comment."
  }
});

// result.status → "consensus" | "partial_consensus" | "unresolved" | "interrupted" | "failed"
// result.claimResolutions → per-claim vote outcomes (incl. evidenceCount)
// result.finalClaims[].evidence → sources cited for each claim
// result.representative → highest-scoring agent
// result.action → action output (if actionPolicy was set)
```

### Evidence

Every claim carries an `evidence` array: sources a reader can check for themselves, such as
`src/app.ts:120`, a URL, a command plus its output, or a quoted passage from the task input.
Agents are told plainly that reasoning is not evidence and that an empty array beats an
invented citation.

Evidence is gathered inside the normal rounds, so it costs no extra model turns. A source
cited while agreeing with a peer's claim corroborates it; a source cited while disagreeing
counts against it. Scoring then discounts each agent's peer-review correctness by how much of
its own output it actually grounded, so the agent that can point at something outranks the
agent that merely sounded convincing — and it is the top scorer that writes the final report.

Votes still decide whether a claim is `resolved`. What changes is that a claim voted through
with nothing behind it is now visible instead of invisible: `evidenceCount` lands in
`result.json`, the CLI tags it `(no evidence)`, and the viewer says `no evidence cited`.
See [docs/adr/0003-claim-grounding.md](docs/adr/0003-claim-grounding.md).

### Integration Example: Claude Code Hook

You can wire argue into existing tools via hooks. For example, as a [Claude Code hook](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks) that triggers multi-agent review before every commit:

```jsonc
// .claude/settings.json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "node ./hooks/argue-review.mjs \"$TASK_INPUT\""
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

```ts
// hooks/argue-review.mjs
import { ArgueEngine, MemorySessionStore, DefaultWaitCoordinator } from "@onevcat/argue";

// Your delegate implementation dispatches to your agent infrastructure
import { createDelegate } from "./my-delegate.mjs";

const input = JSON.parse(process.argv[2]);
if (!input.command?.includes("git commit")) process.exit(0);

const delegate = createDelegate();
const engine = new ArgueEngine({
  taskDelegate: delegate,
  sessionStore: new MemorySessionStore(),
  waitCoordinator: new DefaultWaitCoordinator(delegate)
});

const result = await engine.start({
  requestId: `pre-commit-${Date.now()}`,
  task: "Review staged changes for bugs, security issues, and style violations",
  participants: [
    { id: "security", role: "security-reviewer" },
    { id: "quality", role: "code-quality-reviewer" }
  ],
  roundPolicy: { minRounds: 1, maxRounds: 2 },
  consensusPolicy: { threshold: 1.0 }
});

if (result.status !== "consensus") {
  console.error("Review did not reach consensus. Blocking commit.");
  process.exit(1);
}
```

### Phase Rules

| Phase                 | What agents do                                                    | What the engine does                                    |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Initial** (round 0) | Propose claims, judge existing ones                               | Collect all claims into a shared pool                   |
| **Debate** (1..N)     | Judge peers' claims (`agree`/`disagree`/`revise`), propose merges | Merge duplicates, track stance shifts, check early-stop |
| **Final Vote** (N+1)  | Cast `accept`/`reject` per active claim                           | Compute per-claim consensus against threshold           |

### Key Mechanisms

- **Claim lifecycle**: Each claim is `active`, `merged`, or `withdrawn`. Merged claims transfer their proposers to the surviving claim.
- **Early stop**: If all judgements agree and no new claims emerge for `minRounds`, debate ends early — no wasted rounds.
- **Elimination**: Agents that timeout or error are permanently removed. Consensus denominators adjust automatically.
- **Scoring**: Agents are scored on correctness (35%), completeness (25%), actionability (25%), and consistency (15%) via peer review.
- **Representative**: The highest-scoring agent composes the final report. Falls back to a built-in summary on failure.
- **Action**: Optionally, the representative (or a designated agent) executes a real-world action based on the consensus.

### Provider Types

The CLI supports four provider types for connecting agents:

| Type   | Use case                             | Example                                              |
| ------ | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `cli`  | Coding agents with CLI interfaces    | Claude Code, Codex CLI, Copilot CLI, Gemini CLI      |
| `api`  | Direct model API access              | OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, any OpenAI-compatible API |
| `sdk`  | Custom adapters for agent frameworks | Your own SDK integration                             |
| `mock` | Testing and development              | Deterministic responses, simulated timeouts          |

## Config Reference

Full config example at [`packages/argue-cli/examples/config.example.json`](packages/argue-cli/examples/config.example.json).

`reasoning` is an optional string on both provider model config and agent config:

- `providers.<id>.models.<modelId>.reasoning`: model-level default
- `agents[].reasoning`: per-agent override

Reasoning passthrough is best-effort and depends on provider type/runtime path:

- `cli` providers:
  - `claude` → `--effort <reasoning>`
  - `codex` → `-c model_reasoning_effort=<reasoning>`
  - `generic` → included in the stdin envelope as `agent.reasoning`
  - other `cliType` values → no-op with a warning (once per runner)
- `api` providers: currently no-op (field is accepted in config but not forwarded yet)

User responsibility:

- `argue` only stores/forwards the string and does not validate provider-specific accepted values.
- Compatibility with downstream model/tool capabilities is up to the user.
- If a provider rejects a value, the error surfaces from the downstream runtime/API.

Config lookup order:

1. `--config <path>` flag
2. `./argue.config.json` (local)
3. `~/.config/argue/config.json` (global)

CLI flags override input JSON, which overrides config defaults.
